# Shoe_Price_Prediction

The Shoe Price Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application designed to predict the estimated market price of a shoe based on its features. Users can input various attributes—such as brand, model, type, material, color, gender, and size—and the system intelligently analyzes these factors to generate the predicted price in both USD and INR.

The project combines data-driven prediction, modern UI design, and Flask-based backend integration to create a smooth, user-friendly experience. The system stores prediction history, allows users to log in, and provides a dashboard for insights. It aims to help shoppers, sellers, and retailers understand market trends and estimate a shoe’s value before buying or listing it.

This project demonstrates the practical use of machine learning, web development, database management, and UI/UX design.
